## Problem Description

Given a singly linked list and an integer `x`, delete the `x`-th node from the singly linked list.

## Input

The input consists of the following elements:

- A singly linked list, represented as nodes.
- An integer `x`, representing the position of the node to delete (1-based indexing).

## Output

The output should be the head of the modified linked list after deleting the `x`-th node.

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Input
- Linked List: `1 -> 3 -> 4`
- `x = 3`

#### Output
- Modified Linked List: `1 -> 3`

#### Explanation
- After deleting the node at the 3rd position (1-based indexing), the linked list is as `1 -> 3`.

### Example 2

#### Input
- Linked List: `1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 9`
- `x = 2`

#### Output
- Modified Linked List: `1 -> 2 -> 9`

#### Explanation
- After deleting the node at the 2nd position (1-based indexing), the linked list is as `1 -> 2 -> 9`.

## User Task

Your task is to complete the method `deleteNode()` which takes two arguments: the address of the head of the linked list and an integer `x`. The function returns the head of the modified linked list.

## Constraints

- 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ x ≤ N

## Expected Complexity

- Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
- Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
