## Problem Description

You are given an array `arr` of `n` elements that is first strictly increasing and then may be strictly decreasing. Your task is to find the maximum element in the array.

Note: If the array is strictly increasing, then the last element will be the maximum value.

## Input

The input consists of the following elements:

- An integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), which represents the number of elements in the array.
- An array `arr[]` of length `n`, containing integers. The array is first strictly increasing and then may be strictly decreasing. (1 ≤ arri ≤ 10^6)

## Output

The output should be the maximum element in the array.

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Input
- `n = 9`
- `arr[] = {1, 15, 25, 45, 42, 21, 17, 12, 11}`

#### Output
- Maximum element: 45

#### Explanation
- The maximum element is 45.

### Example 2

#### Input
- `n = 5`
- `arr[] = {1, 45, 47, 50, 5}`

#### Output
- Maximum element: 50

#### Explanation
- The maximum element is 50.

## Your Task

You are required to complete the function `findMaximum()`, which takes the array `arr[]` and `n` as parameters and returns an integer denoting the maximum value.

## Constraints

- 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
- 1 ≤ arri ≤ 10^6

## Expected Complexity

- Expected Time Complexity: O(logn)
- Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
