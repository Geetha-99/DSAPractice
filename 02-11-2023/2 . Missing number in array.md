## Problem Description

You are given an array of size `N-1` containing distinct integers in the range from 1 to `N`. Your task is to find the missing element in the sequence.

## Input

The input consists of the following elements:

- An integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6), which represents the total number of elements that should be in the sequence.
- An array `A[]` of length `N-1`, containing distinct integers in the range from 1 to `N`. There's one element missing in the sequence.

## Output

The output should be the missing element in the sequence.

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Input
- `N = 5`
- `A[] = {1, 2, 3, 5}`

#### Output
- Missing element: 4

### Example 2

#### Input
- `N = 10`
- `A[] = {6, 1, 2, 8, 3, 4, 7, 10, 5}`

#### Output
- Missing element: 9

## Your Task

You are required to complete the function `MissingNumber()`, which takes the array `A[]` and `N` as input parameters and returns the value of the missing number.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
- 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^6

## Expected Complexity

- Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
- Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
