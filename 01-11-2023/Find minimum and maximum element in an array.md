## Description

You are given an array `A` of size `N` containing integers. Your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
- `N = 6`
- `A[] = {3, 2, 1, 56, 10000, 167}`

**Output:** `1 10000`

**Explanation:* The minimum and maximum elements of the array are 1 and 10000, respectively.

### Example 2:

*Input:*
- N = 5
- A[] = {1, 345, 234, 21, 56789}

*Output:* 1 56789

*Explanation:* The minimum and maximum elements of the array are 1 and 56789, respectively.

## Your Task

Your task is to complete the function getMinMax() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the minimum and maximum elements of the array.

## Constraints

- 1 <= N <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^12
### Complexity Requirements

- *Expected Time Complexity:* O(N)
- *Expected Auxiliary Space:* O(1)
