## Problem Description

Given a binary tree, find the Postorder Traversal of it.

## Input

The input consists of a binary tree.

## Output

The output should be an array containing the postorder traversal of the given Binary Tree.

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Input

    19
 /     \
10      8
/
11 13

#### Output
11 13 10 8 19


### Example 2

## User Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `postOrder()` which takes the root node as input and returns an array containing the postorder traversal of the given Binary Tree.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ Number of nodes ≤ 10^5
- 0 ≤ Data of a node ≤ 10^6

## Expected Complexity

- Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
- Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
