## Problem Description

Write a program to find the transpose of a square matrix of size `N * N`. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by changing rows to columns and columns to rows.

## Input

The input consists of the following elements:

- An integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), representing the size of the square matrix.
- A 2D matrix `mat[][]` of size `N * N`, containing integers.

## Output

The output should be the transpose of the input matrix. You need to update the original matrix with the transpose in-place.

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Input
- `N = 4`
- `mat[][] = {{1, 1, 1, 1},
           {2, 2, 2, 2}
           {3, 3, 3, 3}
           {4, 4, 4, 4}}`

#### Output
- Transposed matrix:
{{1, 2, 3, 4},  
 {1, 2, 3, 4}  
 {1, 2, 3, 4}
 {1, 2, 3, 4}} 

### Example 2

#### Input
- `N = 2`
- `mat[][] = {{1, 2},
           {-9, -2}}`

#### Output
- Transposed matrix:
{{1, -9}, 
 {2, -2}}

## Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function `transpose()`, which takes `matrix[][]` and `N` as input parameters and finds the transpose of the input matrix in-place.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100

## Expected Complexity

- Expected Time Complexity: O(N * N)
- Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
