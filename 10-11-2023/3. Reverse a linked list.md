## Problem Description

Given a linked list of `N` nodes, the task is to reverse this list.

## Input

The input consists of the following elements:

- The linked list, represented as nodes with data values.

## Output

The output should be the reversed linked list, represented as nodes.

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Input
- LinkedList: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`

#### Output
- Reversed List: `6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`

#### Explanation
- After reversing the list, the elements are `6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`.

### Example 2

#### Input
- LinkedList: `2 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10`

#### Output
- Reversed List: `10 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7 -> 2`

#### Explanation
- After reversing the list, the elements are `10 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7 -> 2`.

## User Task

The task is to complete the function `reverseList()` with the head reference as the only argument and should return the new head after reversing the list.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4

## Expected Complexity

- Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
- Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
