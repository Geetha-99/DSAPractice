# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

A matrix is constructed of size `n * n` such that `M[i][j] = i + j`. Count the number of cells having value `q`.

**Note:** Assume the array is in 1-based indexing.

## Input

The input consists of the following elements:

- An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), representing the size of the square matrix.
- An integer `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^18), representing the value to count in the matrix.

## Output

The output should be an integer, which is the count of occurrences of `q` in the `n * n` matrix.

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Input
- `n = 4`
- `q = 7`

#### Output
- Count: 2

#### Explanation
- The matrix becomes:

2 3 4 5
3 4 5 6
4 5 6 7
5 6 7 8

The count of `7` is 2.

### Example 2

#### Input
- `n = 5`
- `q = 4`

#### Output
- Count: 3

#### Explanation
- The matrix becomes:

2 3 4 5 6
3 4 5 6 7
4 5 6 7 8
5 6 7 8 9
6 7 8 9 10


The count of `4` is 3.

## Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function `sumMatrix()`, which takes two integers `n` and `q` as input and returns the count of `q` in the `n * n` matrix.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 10^18

## Expected Complexity

- Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
- Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
