# Problem Statement
[Question link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotate-by-90-degree-1587115621/1?page=1&sprint=ca8ae412173dbd8346c26a0295d098fd&sortBy=submissions)
## Problem Description

Given a square matrix of size `N x N`. The task is to rotate it by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.

## Input

The input consists of the following elements:

- An integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), representing the size of the square matrix.
- A 2D matrix `matrix[][]` of size `N x N`, containing integers. (1 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 1000)

## Output

There is no specific output to be returned. You are required to implement the `rotateby90()` function to rotate the input matrix by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space. You need to modify the input matrix in-place.

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Input
- `N = 3`
- `matrix[][] = {{1, 2, 3},
              {4, 5, 6}
              {7, 8, 9}}`

#### Output
- Rotated Matrix:
{{3, 6, 9},
 {2, 5, 8},
 {1, 4, 7}}

### Example 2

#### Input
- `N = 2`
- `matrix[][] = {{1, 2},
              {3, 4}}`

#### Output
- Rotated Matrix:
{{2, 4},
 {1, 3}}

## Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function `rotateby90()`, which takes the `matrix[][]` as an input parameter and rotates it by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space. You have to modify the input matrix in-place.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 1000

## Expected Complexity

- Expected Time Complexity: O(N^2)
- Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
