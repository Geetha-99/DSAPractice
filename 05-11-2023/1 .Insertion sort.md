## Problem Description

The task is to complete the `insert()` function, which is used to implement the Insertion Sort algorithm.

## Input

The input consists of the following elements:

- An integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000), representing the number of elements in the array.
- An array `arr[]` of length `N`, containing integers. (1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1000)

## Output

There is no specific output to be returned. You are required to implement the `insert()` and `insertionSort()` functions to sort the array in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Input
- `N = 5`
- `arr[] = {4, 1, 3, 9, 7}`

#### Output
- Sorted array: [1, 3, 4, 7, 9]

#### Explanation
- The input array is sorted in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

### Example 2

#### Input
- `N = 10`
- `arr[] = {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`

#### Output
- Sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

#### Explanation
- The input array is sorted in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

## Your Task

You don't have to read input or print anything. Complete the functions `insert()` and `insertionSort()`:

- `insert(arr, size, i)`: This function takes the array `arr[]`, its size `size`, and an index `i`. It inserts the element at index `i` into the correct position in the sorted subarray.

- `insertionSort(arr, size)`: This function uses the `insert()` function to sort the entire array in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1000

## Expected Complexity

- Expected Time Complexity: O(N^2)
- Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
